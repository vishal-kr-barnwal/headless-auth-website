scalable, plugin-based model for various part of Authentication & Authorization with all Industry Standard like
SAML/SCML, OpenID, JWT, OAuth, Multi-Tenancy, etc.

It can act as an alternative to Firebase Authentication, Azure AD, Okta, etc.

## Authentication / Authorization Landscape
- **_User Data_**:- A central repository for all User Data like Name, Phone Number, Email, etc.
- **_Authorization Store_**:- A central repository for all Role level data from Domain access level, field level, etc.
- **_Multi Tenancy Store_**:- Client ID based construct for having a multi tenant solution.
- **_Application Store_**:- Capability to onboard any Application which support OAuth directly using this server.

These all work together to create a Token which can be used to Access Data or an Application.

Even _VedaVerify_ will be onboarded as application into this ecosystem.
